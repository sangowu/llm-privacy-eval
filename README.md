This repo contains evaluation results from my MSc thesis project on
**privacy risks of LLaMA-3–8B models** under LoRA fine-tuning and RAG.

- Models compared:
  - Base + RAG
  - LoRA only
  - LoRA + RAG
- Metrics:
  - Field-level memorisation & honeytrap leakage
  - Full-database Top-K re-identification success
